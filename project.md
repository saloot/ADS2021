# Final Project
For the course's final project, you have two options
1. Select a paper and reproduce their results
2. Work on a problem you like

We also have a 20 bonus points on the final project's grade. Find out more at the bottom of this page.

Important Notes:
* Note that 30% of the project grade is for the final presentation.
* The projects should be **done individually**.
* Please finalize your choice by **Sunday 28 Azar, 1400**.


## Reproducing the Result of a Paper
For the first option, you can select a paper from the list below, and then reproduce their results. Please go through their abstract and select the paper of your choice by sending us an email.
