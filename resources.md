# Some Datasets for Homeworks
Below, you can find a few datasets you can use for your homeworks. There are just a few suggestions though. If you have a particular dataset in mind, please get in touch and we can sort it out.

### [Achareh](https://achareh.ir)

Achareh is an online platform to hire handymen in over 30 cities in Iran covering more than 300 services related to houses, cars, pets, health and beauty and more. 

The dataset contains over 60,000 orders, scores and transactions placed on Achareh for multiple services. Here's a sample:

### [Ubaar](https://ubaar.ir)

Ubaar is an online platform to connect truck drivers to clients having a shipment to send. It is the first platform to offer instant pricing based on machine learning in Iran and is currently operating domestically in all major cities in Iran as well as internationally for select destinations.

The dataset contains over 60,000 orders, scores and transactions placed on Ubaar for multiple load-types, sources, destinations and truck types.

### [Divar](https://divar.ir)
<img src="/ADS2021/assets/images/divar_logo.jpeg" style="border-radius:50%;height:240px;" width="auto">
I think Divar hardly needs an introduction, as it is the largest classified ads platform in Iran (and probably Afghanistan).

The [dataset](https://phanous.ir/divar-posts-dataset/) "contains 947635 posts that were published in Divar classified ads platform. These posts were published and archived before 2017."


### [Digikala](https://digikala.com)
<img src="/ADS2021/assets/images/digikala_logo.gif" style="border-radius:50%;height:240px;" width="auto">
Digikala hardly needs an introduction either. It is not only the largest e-commerce platform in Iran, but in the Middle East.

The dataset contains over 2 million transactions and 100,000 goods offerred at Digikala.

Note that in order to access this dataset, you'll need the signup through Digikala's [open data](https://www.digikala.com/opendata/) platform using your academic email.
