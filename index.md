# About This Course
In this course, our aim is to get the students STARTED on using data science in practice, either for academic projects or problems in industry which they might face later on in their career. 

The course is more about breadth than depth, i.e. we try to cover a lot of topics, but we won't get too deep in them as it would take "forever"! However, we will work on our search skills, to find the solution we need online (which is a necessary skill for anyone, especially data scientists as this is a rapidly evolving field).

We go over all steps of a data problem workflow, namely: 

Gathering Data → Cleaning → Preprocessing → Analysis → Visualization 

Throught this process, we work on several different sample problems in the lab sessions as well as through homeworks and final projects, in order to help the students be ready for various type of data problems they'll face later on in their careers.

## Learning Objectives
