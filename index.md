# About This Course
This is a good course

# Schedules
This course is about *applied* data science.


# Learning Objectives
* Main aim of the course is to get you STARTED on using data science in PRACTICE

* We go over all steps of a data problem workflow:
   Gathering → Cleaning → Preprocessing → Analysis → Visualization 


* The course covers a lot of topics, but we won’t go deep, i.e. breadth vs. depth. We will learn how to find further details we need online.


* We work on several different sample problems to help you be ready for various problems you’ll face later in your career
